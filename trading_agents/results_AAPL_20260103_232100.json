      "analysis": "As an expert Risk Manager, I have performed a thorough risk assessment for the proposed AAPL trade based on the provided data and risk management parameters. My primary focus is capital preservation and conservative recommendations.\n\n---\n\n### **AAPL Trade Risk Assessment**\n\n**MARKET DATA REVIEW:**\n*   **Current Price:** $271.01\n*   **Volatility (Annualized):** 17.64% - This is moderate for a large-cap stock like AAPL. It suggests a reasonable degree of price stability compared to more volatile assets, but still implies potential daily swings.\n*   **30-Day Return:** 0.91% - Recent short-term performance is modest.\n*   **90-Day Return:** 5.14% - Longer-term performance is positive but not exceptionally strong.\n*   **Sharpe Ratio:** 1.24 - A Sharpe ratio above 1.0 is generally considered good, indicating a decent risk-adjusted return historically.\n\n**OTHER AGENTS' RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n*   **Fundamental Analyst:** HOLD (Confidence: 50%) - A neutral stance with low confidence suggests no strong fundamental catalyst for a buy or sell, adding a layer of uncertainty.\n*   **Sentiment Analyst:** HOLD (Confidence: 50%) - Similar to the fundamental analyst, sentiment is neutral with low conviction. This lack of strong positive sentiment is a cautionary signal.\n\n---\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT TASKS:**\n\n**1. Overall Risk Level: MEDIUM**\n*   While AAPL is a fundamentally strong, highly liquid company with moderate volatility and a decent Sharpe Ratio, the \"HOLD\" recommendations from both the Fundamental and Sentiment Analysts (with low confidence) introduce uncertainty and suggest a lack of immediate strong upside catalysts. This neutral stance, coupled with the need for capital preservation, elevates the risk from \"Low\" to \"Medium\" for a new trade entry.\n\n**2. Volatility and Potential Downside:**\n*   An annualized volatility of 17.64% means that, statistically, the stock price could move by approximately 17.64% over a year. On a daily basis, this translates to roughly 1.1% (17.64% / sqrt(252 trading days)).\n*   A 5% downside from the current price ($271.01) would be a drop of $13.55, reaching $257.46. Given the historical volatility, a 5% move is plausible within a relatively short period (e.g., a few weeks or even days under market stress).\n*   The potential downside is managed by a strict stop-loss.\n\n**3. Correlation with Broader Market:**\n*   AAPL is a mega-cap technology stock and a significant component of major indices like the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100. It exhibits a high positive correlation with the broader market.\n*   This means that any significant market-wide downturn (systematic risk) will likely impact AAPL negatively, regardless of its individual fundamentals. Diversification across sectors and asset classes is crucial to mitigate this.\n\n**4. Liquidity Risk:**\n*   **Negligible.** AAPL is one of the most liquid stocks in the world, with billions of dollars traded daily. Liquidity risk is not a concern for typical portfolio position sizes. Orders can be executed quickly and efficiently without significant price impact.\n\n---\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n**5. Recommended Position Size: 4% of portfolio**\n*   Given the \"Medium\" risk rating and the neutral \"HOLD\" recommendations from analysts, I recommend a conservative position size. This is significantly below the maximum",
